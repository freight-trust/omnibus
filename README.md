## Trading Partner Registration
In order to register, you will need:
• Basic information about your business, including your Federal Tax ID and [IDENTIFICATION_SCHEME]

• Someone with the legal authority (typically an owner or senior partner) to sign agreements for
your organization.

• An office manager or other employee who can oversee the Freight Trust implementation and
maintain User IDs and access.

##  Certification and Testing Overview
All trading partners and clearing houses [Certification process - onboarding process].

## Transmission Administrative Procedure
* Connectivity

Secure File Transfer via Internet
FTP via ISDN, Leased Lines, Frame Relay, VPN
Firewall Mechanics
If you are behind a firewall, make sure that your FTPS client passes the Internet facing IP
address of the server rather than the internal IP. Failure to do so usually causes the
communication break when the client tries to list the files available in the Server or during upload
or download of files.

## Re-Transmission Procedure
* Encryption Method
* Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
* RSA 2048
