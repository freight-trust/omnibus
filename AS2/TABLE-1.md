| **Response Timeout**            | **The number of milliseconds the application waits for a response before canceling its attempt to connect to the back end. In case the network is slow or the back end processing takes longer than usual, increase the Response Timeout value. It is recommended to specify a value other than 0. If you specify 0, the application will wait indefinitely for a response.** |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Retry Count on Response Failure | The number of times the application attempts to connect to the back end to read a response if the initial attempt fails\. If an I/O error occurs, it will retry only if you have selected the Retry on Response Failure option\.                                                                                                                                              |
| Retry on Response Failure       | Whether the application should attempt to resend the request when the response has failed, even though the request was sent successfully\. Select this option if you want to re\-establish the connection\.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Trust store Alias               | Select the alias name of the webMethods\.io Integration trust store configuration from the list\. The trust store contains trusted certificates used to determine trust for the remote server peer certificates\. Select New Certificate > New Truststore to add a new trust store from this list\.                                                                           |
| Keystore Alias                  | Select the alias for the webMethods\.io Integration keystore configuration\. This is a text identifier for the keystore alias\. A keystore file contains the credentials \(private key/signed certificate\) that a client needs for authentication\. Select New Certificate > New Keystore to add a new keystore from this list\.                                             |
| Client Key Alias                | Alias to the private key in the keystore file specified in the Keystore Alias field\. The outbound connections use this key to send client credentials to a remote server\. To send the clientâ€™s identity to a remote server, you must specify values in both, Keystore Alias and Client Key Alias fields\.                                                                   |
| Hostname verifier               | Select a hostname verifier implementation for guards against man\-in\-the\-middle \(MITM\) attacks from the list\. The default is org\.apache\.http\.conn\.ssl\.DefaultHostnameVerifier\. This enables hostname verification\. Select org\.apache\.http\.conn\.ssl\.NoopHostnameVerifier from the list to disable hostname verification\.                                     |
