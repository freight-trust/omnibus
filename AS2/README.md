# AS2 Guide 

> AS2^2

AS2 (Applicability Statement 2) is a communication protocol developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

**AS2 is for the exchange of business-to-business (B2B) transactions over the Internet securely.**

The AS2 application uses the HTTP transport protocol along with Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME). <br>
The AS2 application governs the means of connection and exchange of data securely and reliably.  <br>
Besides the advanced security features, the AS2 application offers the following additional benefits: <br>

Privacy <br>
Authentication <br>
Nonrepudiation of origin and receipt of the message <br>
Data integrity <br>


The AS2 application provides a medium to exchange business data with partners by configuring an account in webMethods.io Integration.
The application supports the AS2 protocol versions 1.1 and 1.2, and our open version of AS 2.0 ( AS2^2 )

### Signing Keystore and Key Aliases	

| **Receive Signed Message**         | **Select this option to receive a signed inbound AS2 message. If you select this option and the incoming AS2 message is not signed, then an Insufficient message security error is encountered and shared with the sender if MDN is requested by the sender.** |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Signature Verification Certificate | The certificate to use for verifying an inbound signed AS2 message\.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Encryption Algorithm               | The encryption algorithm to use for an outbound AS2 message\.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |


Encryption Certificate	The certificate to use for encrypting an outbound AS2 message.
Receive Encrypted Message	Select this option to receive an encrypted inbound AS2 message.

If you select this option and the incoming AS2 message is not encrypted, then an Insufficient message security error is encountered and shared with the sender if 
MDN is requested by the sender.

Decryption Keystore and Key Aliases	The keystore aliases the key aliases in the keystore to use for decrypting an inbound AS2 message.

Request MDN	Whether you want the recipient to return an MDN to the sender.


None: The recipient of the AS2 message does not return an MDN to the sender.

##### Synchronous: 
The recipient of the AS2 message returns an MDN to the sender through the same HTTP connection used to send the original AS2 message.

##### Asynchronous: 
The recipient of the AS2 message returns an MDN to the sender through a different HTTP connection instead of the one used to send the original AS2 message.

##### Request Signed MDN	
Select this option if you want the recipient to sign an AS2 MDN.
Ensure that you also select an option in the Request MDN field if you want the recipient to sign and return an AS2 MDN.

##### Asynchronous MDN Endpoint	

Type your endpoint URL that accepts an inbound AS2 MDN if you selected the Asynchronous option for Request MDN.


##### AS2 Version	
Select  the AS2 protocol version to use from the list.

#### Enable SNI	

Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension to the TLS protocol by which a client indicates which host name it is attempting to connect to at the start of the handshaking process. 
Enable this option if the SaaS provider offers SNI-based TLS connectivity, and if you want to connect to an SNI enabled SAAS provider to send the host name specified in the Server URL field.
Aas part of the TLS SNI Extension `server_name` parameter, [see Network Admini Guidance](#) 

##### SNI Server Name	

If you want to explicitly specify a host name to be included as a part of the SNI extension server_name parameter,
 in case the host name is other than the host name specified in the Server URL field, specify the host name value in the SNI Server Name field.


#### AS2 Predefined Operations
The following predefined Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) operations are available:
